# CTF Challenge

This is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and cryptographic techniques. The challenge involves decrypting a piece of encrypted data using a password provided by the user.

## Introduction

The CTF challenge simulates a scenario where a user is required to decrypt a piece of data using a password. The encrypted data is generated using the AES encryption algorithm, and the password is hashed using bcrypt for secure storage. Participants need to provide the correct password to decrypt the data and complete the challenge.

## Features

- AES encryption and decryption for data security
- Password hashing using bcrypt for secure storage
- User-friendly web interface for interaction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sooperdoob/bcrypt-ctf.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd bcrypt-ctf
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Enter the password into the provided input field.
3. Click the "Submit" button to check if the password is correct.
4. If the password is correct, the decrypted data will be displayed.
